/**
 * no-reexport-only-module — a module whose whole top level is `export … from`
 * forwards a name without owning anything. It reads as a module and costs an
 * import hop, but no decision lives in it.
 *
 * The rule exists because a size budget (`max-lines`) can be satisfied by
 * moving every body out of a file and leaving the exports behind. That turns a
 * too-large module into a barrel without anyone deciding the module was the
 * wrong shape, and the next reader still has to open every sibling to find the
 * code. Either point callers at the real modules, or leave something here that
 * composes them.
 *
 * A file is flagged when it has at least one `export … from` / `export *` and
 * no other top-level statement except imports. Imports do not rescue a file:
 * an import feeding only a re-export is still forwarding. Anything that
 * declares or runs (a function, a const, a local `export {}` of something
 * declared above, a default export) makes it a real module.
 *
 * `index.ts`/`index.tsx` are exempt by default — a package's public surface is
 * exactly the case where forwarding IS the job — and so are the Next App Router
 * files (`page`/`layout`/`route`), which a framework requires to EXIST at a
 * path; forwarding the component is the only body they can have. Add more
 * escape hatches with `{ allow: ["public-api.ts"] }`, matched against the
 * file's basename or the tail of its path.
 *
 * The index exemption covers `index-*.ts` too. A barrel that outgrows
 * `max-lines` has to continue somewhere, and those halves are the same public
 * surface under a second filename — not a module hiding its body.
